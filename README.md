Send Flight Simulator Plane Position to Windows Bing Maps App

Microsoft Flight Simulator Ingame VFR Map only has limited infos. This application will retrieve the current plane position from Flight Simulator and create an bingmaps application url from that which will show the position in the windows maps app (usually installed on every windows 10 device, if not get it from the Microsoft Store https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-maps/9wzdncrdtbvb?activetab=pivot:overviewtab ).

Updates can be triggered manually or automatically (update interval can be specified).

Windows Maps app should be placed on a second monitor though it will also work with only one (disable Keep FS Window Focused) to keep the Maps app in Front. Using a seperate computer still needs to be tested.
